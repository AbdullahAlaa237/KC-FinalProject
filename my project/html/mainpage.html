    <p class="p">
      Pollution is generally the result of changes within the environment
      surrounding living organisms, through daily human activities that cause
      the emergence of resources that do not correspond to the place where the
      organism lives.

              <p>
                Air pollution is a type of environmental pollution that affects
                the air and is usually caused by smoke or other harmful gases,
                mainly oxides of carbon, sulphur and nitrogen. In other words,
                air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence or
                introduction of a substance which has a poisonous effect. Many
                of the world's large cities today have polluted air or low air
                and complain about it’s daily quality. Even 2,000 years ago, the
                Romans were complaining about the polluted air in their cities.
                At that time, the air was thick with smoke from fires and the
                smell of sewers. Air pollution has been classified as a danger
                to human health and Earth's many ecosystems for a long time.

              <h1>Water Pollution</h1>
              <p>
                Water pollution is the pollution of bodies of water, such as
                lakes, rivers, seas, the oceans, as well as groundwater. It
                occurs when pollutants reach these bodies of water, without
                treatment. Waste from homes, factories and other buildings get
                into the water bodies and as a result water gets contaminated.

    <p class="p">
      Recycling is a method of procedure that includes the collection and
      breaking down of waste material to create something new out of it. The
      process was introduced sot that the non-biodegradable materials can be
      melted or break down to create something useful. After the effects of
      global warming and pollution have become known to men the process of
      recycling has become more important.

    <h2 class="protect">Why We Need Recycling?</h2>

    <p class="p">
      We need recycling for many reasons. But most importantly, it will help us
      to save our planet. Besides, recycling saves the earth by facilitating the
      reprocess of paper which will save millions of trees. Also, recycling
      saves a lot of energy because many things that we recycle can easily be
      converted into virgin materials. In addition, it saves a lot of resources
      too. Moreover, recycling reduces the burden of the environment. As we save
      energy the number of greenhouse gases and oxides are produced in less
      quantity. Because most of the toxic gases are produced by factories. In
      addition, recycling reduces the amount of waste, that takes years to
      decompose. Also, the recycled material can be sold. We use this recycled
      material for the manufacturing of many new products. So, ultimately
      recycling saves money.
    </p>

    <h2 class="protect">The Process of Recycling</h2>
    <p class="p">
      The various materials that we recycle have to go through a process that
      refines and purifies them. Besides, different materials go through a
      different process and in this topic we will discuss the recycling process
      of various materials.
    </p>
    <h4 class="recycle">Paper</h4>
    <p class="p">
      It is the most used material on the earth. Paper is made up of two
      materials water and wood. For recycling paper firstly they break it down
      in small pieces and dissolve it into water. After that, they add chemicals
      that filter out the ink and dirt from it. In addition after filtering the
      paper takes the form of a mush called the pulp and this pulp is later
      converted into clean paper.
    </p>

    <h4 class="recycle">Metals</h4>
    <p class="p">
      The metals are first shredded into small pieces and then they were melted
      and after that remolded into new shapes.
    </p>
    <h4 class="recycle">Plastic</h4>
    <p class="p">
      They also follow the same process as plastic. But, the process of plastic
      recycling is a little bit complex because they have to sort out the
      different types of plastics. As there is a diverse variety of plastic with
      different properties.
    </p>

    <h2 class="protect" id="Saving-Energy">Energy Conservation</h2>

    <p class="p">
      Energy conservation refers to the efforts made to reduce the consumption
      of energy. The energy on Earth is not in unlimited supply. Furthermore,
      energy can take plenty of time to regenerate. This certainly makes it
      essential to conserve energy. Most noteworthy, energy conservation is
      achievable either by using energy more efficiently or by reducing the
      amount of service usage.
    </p>

      alt=""
    />

    <h2 class="protect">Importance of Energy Conservation</h2>

    <p class="p">
      First of all, energy conservation plays an important role in saving
      non-renewable energy resources. Furthermore, non-renewable energy sources
      take many centuries to regenerate. Moreover, humans consume energy at a
      faster rate than it can be produced. Therefore, energy conservation would
      lead to the preservation of these precious non-renewable sources of
      energy. Energy conservation will reduce the expenses related to fossil
      fuels. Fossil fuels are very expensive to mine. Therefore, consumers are
      required to pay higher prices for goods and services. Energy conservation
      would certainly reduce the amount of fossil fuel being mined. This, in
      turn, would reduce the costs of consumers. Consequently, energy
      conservation would strengthen the economy as consumers will have more
      disposable income to spend on goods and services. Energy conservation is
      good for scientific research. This is because; energy conservation gives
      researchers plenty of time to conduct researches. Therefore, these
      researchers will have more time to come up with various energy solutions
      and alternatives. Humans must ensure to have fossil fuels as long as
      possible. This would give me enough time to finding practical solutions.

    <h2 class="protect" id="Saving-Water">Importance of Water in Life</h2>

    <p class="p">
      Water is an indispensable component of life. We cannot survive without
      water. The human body comprises of a huge amount of water. Thus, human
      beings and animals need much water to drink. Also, plants need water to
      grow. From drinking to cooking to everything, we need water. We need safe
      water for all our organs to function properly. Moreover, we can preserve
      our environment by saving water. An excellent example of this is the use
      of water to produce electricity. The use of hydropower or hydroelectricity
      helps in controlling pollution. Furthermore, it prevents the burning of
      fossil fuels, coal, etc. for producing electricity. Also, it is essential
      for maintaining the Earth’s temperature. The human body is made up of a
      huge amount of water. Thus, human beings and animals need much water to
      drink. Also, plants need water to grow. From drinking to cooking to
      everything, we need water.

    <h2 class="protect hvr-bounce-in">How to Save Water?</h2>
    <p class="p">
      Water is the most precious component needed for food and life. All human
      beings, animals and plants have a requirement of water. Thus, we need to
      conserve water resources. To conserve or decrease the polluting factors,
      we must be aware of the factors that lead to its deterioration. Then, we
      must take some valuable steps. These include turning off the taps, cut
      down meat-eating and dairy. Also, we must check for water leakage from
      hand pumps, shower less to save water. Moreover, we must have a pond to
      use water. Furthermore, the dumping of sewage and toxins into water bodies
      is a major reason for water pollution. Moreover, fertilizers require a
      huge amount of water. Thus, we must minimize the use of fertilizers in the
      fields. Also, we must check for soil erosion by planting trees.
