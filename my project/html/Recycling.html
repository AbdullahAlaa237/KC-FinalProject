    <h1 class="p">Recycling Basics</h1>

    <p class="p">
      Recycling is the process of collecting and processing materials that would
      otherwise be thrown away as trash and turning them into new products.
      Recycling can benefit your community and the environment.

    <h3 class="one" id="Recycling">Steps to Recycling Materials</h3>

    <p class="p1">
      Recycling includes the three steps below, which create a continuous loop,
      represented by the familiar recycling symbol.
    </p>

    <h4 class="two">Step 1: Collection and Processing</h4>

    <p class="p1">
      There are several methods for collecting recyclables, including curbside
      collection, drop-off centers, and deposit or refund programs. After
      collection, recyclables are sent to a recovery facility to be sorted,
      cleaned and processed into materials that can be used in manufacturing.
      Recyclables are bought and sold just like raw materials would be, and
      prices go up and down depending on supply and demand in the United States
      and the world.
    </p>

    <h4 class="two">Step 2: Manufacturing</h4>

    <p class="p1">
      More and more of today's products are being manufactured with recycled
      content. Common household items that contain recycled materials include
      the following:
    </p>

    <ul class="menu">
      <li>Newspapers and paper towels</li>
      <li>Aluminum, plastic, and glass soft drink containers</li>
      <li>Steel cans</li>
      <li>Plastic laundry detergent bottles</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p1">
      Recycled materials are also used in new ways such as recovered glass in
      asphalt to pave roads or recovered plastic in carpeting and park benches.
    </p>

    <h4 class="two">
      Step 3: Purchasing New Products Made from Recycled Materials
    </h4>
    <p class="p1">
      You help close the recycling loop by buying new products made from
      recycled materials. There are thousands of products that contain recycled
      content. When you go shopping, look for the following:
    </p>

    <ul class="menu">
      <li>Products that can be easily recycled</li>

      <li>Products that contain recycled content</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size: x-large">Below are some of the terms used:</p>

    <ul class="menu1">
      <li>
        Recycled-content product - The product was manufactured with recycled
        materials either collected from a recycling program or from waste
        recovered during the normal manufacturing process. The label will
        sometimes include how much of the content was from recycled materials.
      </li>

      <li>
        Post-consumer content - Very similar to recycled content, but the
        material comes only from recyclables collected from consumers or
        businesses through a recycling program.
      </li>

      <li>
        Recyclable product - Products that can be collected, processed and
        manufactured into new products after they have been used. These products
        do not necessarily contain recycled materials. Remember not all kinds of
        recyclables may be collected in your community so be sure to check with
        your local recycling program before you buy.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="p1">
      Some of the common products you can find that can be made with recycled
      content include the following:
    </p>

    <ul class="menu1">
      <li>Aluminum cans</li>
      <li>Car bumpers</li>
      <li>Carpeting</li>
      <li>Cereal boxes</li>
      <li>Comic books</li>
      <li>Egg cartons</li>
      <li>Glass containers</li>
      <li>Laundry detergent bottles</li>
      <li>Motor oil</li>
      <li>Nails</li>
      <li>Newspapers</li>
      <li>Paper towels</li>
      <li>Steel products</li>
      <li>Trash bags</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="one" id="Jobs">Recycling Creates Jobs</h3>

    <p class="p1">
      EPA released significant findings on the economic benefits of the
      recycling industry with an update to the national Recycling Economic
      Information (REI) Study in 2016. This study analyzes the numbers of jobs,
      wages and tax revenues attributed to recycling. The study found that in a
      single year, recycling and reuse activities in the United States accounted
      for:
    </p>

    <ul class="menu">
      <li>681,000 jobs</li>

      <li>$37.8 billion in wages; and</li>

      <li>$5.5 billion in tax revenues.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="p1">
      This equates to 1.17 jobs per 1,000 tons of materials recycled and $65.23
      in wages and $9.42 in tax revenue for every ton of materials recycled.
